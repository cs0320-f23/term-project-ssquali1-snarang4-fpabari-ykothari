#### How to Run Tests

. To run the tests, make sure that you are CD into maps-gjacobs5-fpabari. You should have playwright installed
but if you don't, in your terminal type:
npx playwright install
once that is done, go back to your terminal and run the following commands to run the tests:
npx playwright test - runs the tests
npx playwright test --ui - opens a UI that allows for you to watch and run your tests as if in a live browser

#### How to Run Program

. To run the program, make sure that you are CD into maps-gjacobs5-fpabaris. You should have npm installed
but if you don't, in your terminal type:
npm install
once that is done, go back to your terminal and run the following command to start the server:
npm start
open the local server that was started in your browser and then you can use it!

    To switch between modes type "mode" into the REPL box.
        There are two modes - brief and verbose. Brief only shows the output while verbose
        shows a more extensive output, including the command that was inputted into the REPL.
        The frontend automatically begins in brief mode.
    To load a file, type the command "file_load [fileName]" into the REPL box.
    To view a file, type "view" into the REPL box.
        In order to view a file, a file must be loaded first.
    To search for something within a file, type "search [col] [value]" into the REPL box.
        Where column can be either the name of the header of the column or the index of the column.
        To do a hollistic search of the file, the user would end up inputting -1 into the column box,
        but that is more of a thing to take care of once we connect our backend to frontend.
        A file must be loaded in inorder to be able to search..
